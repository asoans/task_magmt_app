# Cross-platform Mobile Application for Task Management

## Concept

Develop a powerful task management app that simplifies your daily routine by allowing you to create, manage, and track tasks and to-dos efficiently. This cross-platform mobile application will come equipped with essential features such as task categorization, timely notifications, and seamless cloud synchronization.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React Native**: A leading framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with both Android and iOS platforms.

### Backend

- **Node.js with Express.js**: A robust backend technology stack that enables us to build a scalable and efficient API to power the application.

### Database

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database, an integral part of the MERN stack, providing flexibility and performance for data storage and retrieval.

### Authentication

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A secure authentication method that ensures user data remains protected and accessible only to authorized individuals.

### Cloud Services

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Utilizing AWS services like DynamoDB for NoSQL data storage, EC2 for hosting the backend, S3 for storing files, and Cognito for user authentication.

### Additional Technologies

- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes in code and collaborating with team members effectively.

- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript code for improved code quality, maintenance, and development.

- **Redux**: A state management library that simplifies the management of application state and ensures data consistency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Install Node.js to run the backend server.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): Set up a MongoDB instance to store data.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-app.git
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/taskmanagement
   JWT_SECRET=yoursecretkey
   ```

5. Start the frontend and backend servers:

   ```bash
   # Start frontend
   cd frontend
   npm start

   # Start backend
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the application:

   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app.

## Features

- Create tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates.
- Organize tasks into categories for better management.
- Receive timely notifications for upcoming tasks.
- Synchronize your tasks seamlessly with cloud storage.
- Secure login and authentication using JWT.
- Cross-platform compatibility with React Native.
